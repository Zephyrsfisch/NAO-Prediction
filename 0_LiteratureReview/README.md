**Summary of Each Work**:

- **Source 1**: A Review of Predictability Studies of Atlantic Sector Climate on Decadal Time Scales

  - https://oceanrep.geomar.de/id/eprint/6884/1/JCLI3945.pdf

  - **Objective**:
                -To assess how predictable the North Atlantic climate system is, especially the NAO, across multi-year to decadal timescales.

  - **Methods**:
                -Review of observational datasets, reanalysis products, and long-term climate records.

                - Comparison of statistical models and decadal prediction model experiments.

                -Evaluation of forecast skill using hindcasts and perfect-model simulations.

  - **Outcomes**:
                -NAO predictability exists but is limited and strongly influenced by ocean conditions 

                - Models can capture long-term variability but struggle with short-term transitions.

                -Prediction skill varies by season, with winter NAO showing higher potential.

                -Large uncertainties arise from model bias and internal atmospheric variability.

  - **Relation to the Project**: 
                -Helps set realistic expectations for NAO prediction accuracy using machine learnig

                -Identifies important predictors such as SST anomalies and ocean circulation.

                -Highlights challenges like variability and noise, guiding data preprocessing and model design.
